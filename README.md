# Practice Camera Pipelining

Welcome to **Practice_Camera_Pipelining**! This repository is dedicated to the exploration and practical implementation of camera imaging pipelines. It is designed for students, enthusiasts, and professionals who want hands-on experience with the essential stages of digital image processing as performed in modern cameras.

## What is Camera Pipelining?

A camera imaging pipeline refers to the sequence of processing steps that raw sensor data undergoes to become a final, visually appealing image. This typically includes operations such as:

- **Demosaicing** (reconstructing full-color images from sensor data)
- **White balancing**
- **Color correction**
- **Denoising**
- **Sharpening**
- **Gamma correction**
- **Image compression**

Understanding these steps is crucial for anyone interested in computer vision, digital photography, or image processing.

## What Will You Find in This Repository?

This repo provides:

- **Implementation of Key Camera Pipeline Stages**  
  Python (and possibly other languages) code for major pipeline steps, with clear, modular functions and explanations.

- **Sample Raw Images and Test Data**  
  Example raw sensor images (or links to datasets) to use for testing and experimentation.

- **Step-by-Step Tutorials & Notebooks**  
  Jupyter Notebooks and markdown guides walking you through each pipeline stage, with visualizations of results.

- **Reference Material**  
  Resources, articles, and further reading for deeper understanding of camera pipelines.

- **Practice Tasks & Challenges**  
  Exercises for you to implement and improve upon pipeline components.

## Who Is This For?

- **Students and learners** in image processing or computer vision
- **Photographers and hobbyists** curious about how camera images are formed
- **Engineers and developers** wanting to prototype or test camera algorithms

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sand33pshah/Practice_Camera_Pipelining.git
   cd Practice_Camera_Pipelining
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**  
   Most code will use standard Python libraries (`numpy`, `opencv-python`, `matplotlib`).  
   You can install these via:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the tutorials or scripts:**  
   Open the Jupyter notebooks or run the Python scripts in the repo to start experimenting.
